      <!-- Each stanza wrapped in <p> for structure -->
      <p>Not like the passing clouds ☁️ <br> That quickly pass and fade 💨 <br> I want to be your blue sky 💙 <br> Through every low and high ✨️</p>
      <p>I'll be your sunshine, warm and bright 🌞 <br> Even in dark times — your northern light 🌌 <br> It’s not just about how I feel 😊 <br> But a yearning deep, for you to heal 🕊</p>
      <p>I heard the whisper of my soul 🧬 <br> That was the moment I lost control 🌠 <br> I promise, I’ll take care — with heart ❤️‍🩹 <br> Not to be your scar, but a healing part 🩹</p>
      <p>In these emotions, I’m a newborn child 👼 <br> My sighs and plays, gentle and mild 🍼 <br> But if it feels heavy or too hard 🙄 <br> Please speak freely — don’t just guard 🔒</p>
      <p>My intentions aren't just born of lust ❌️ <br> But from deep intuitions I truly trust ✔️ <br> Though feelings are strong, I still hide 🙈 <br> Because I don’t know what's on your side 🤔</p>
      <p>I know your heart has been through pain 💔 <br> Old love that left a mark like rain 🌧 <br> But I am here with care that's true ❣️ <br> To bring back light and peace to you ✨️</p>
      <p>You’re a golden soul I long to hold ✨️ <br> But fear your past still has its hold. <br> In my heart, there’s storm and rain ⛈️ <br> Afraid to cause you any pain 🥺</p>
      <p>I'll not be a cage that easily gets bore 😐 <br> But it'll be a sky where you freely explore 🪂 <br> Just flap your wings and freely fly 🕊 <br> I'll just admire as you rise high ✌️</p>
      <p>Not just short hyped roller coaster ride 🎢 <br> Until the life together we can stride 🤝 <br> I'll be both good friend and life partner 💍 <br> In both personal and professional chapter👩‍🎓</p>
      <p>Now I stand in a strong decision 💪 <br> To bring this love to a family vision 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 <br> Even if the path is tough to ride 📈 <br> I’ll hold your hand — and walk beside 👫</p>
      <p>If this turns to love, I’ll hold it tight 🤝 <br> If not, I’ll still wish you the light ❣️ <br> Even as your closest friend 👫 <br> My care for you will never end ♾️</p>
      <p>My love intuition is still optimistic 😌 <br> If I'm not wrong, I saw an incident click <br> I asked you so many times to guess 🙄 <br> But with brevity now I confess 💐</p>

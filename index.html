      <pre>
Not like the passing clouds ☁️  
That quickly pass and fade 💨  
I want to be your blue sky 💙  
Through every low and high ✨️  

I'll be your sunshine, warm and bright 🌞  
Even in dark times — your northern light 🌌  
It’s not just about how I feel 😊  
But a yearning deep, for you to heal 🕊  

I heard the whisper of my soul 🧬  
That was the moment I lost control 🌠  
I promise, I’ll take care — with heart ❤️‍🩹  
Not to be your scar, but a healing part 🩹  

In these emotions, I’m a newborn child 👼  
My sighs and plays, gentle and mild 🍼  
But if it feels heavy or too hard 🙄  
Please speak freely — don’t just guard 🔒  

My intentions aren't just born of lust ❌️  
But from deep intuitions I truly trust ✔️  
Though feelings are strong, I still hide 🙈  
Because I don’t know what's on your side 🤔  

I know your heart has been through pain 💔  
Old love that left a mark like rain 🌧  
But I am here with care that's true ❣️  
To bring back light and peace to you ✨️  

You’re a golden soul I long to hold ✨️  
But fear your past still has its hold.  
In my heart, there’s storm and rain ⛈️  
Afraid to cause you any pain 🥺  

I'll not be a cage that easily gets bore 😐  
But it'll be a sky where you freely explore 🪂  
Just flap your wings and freely fly 🕊  
I'll just admire as you rise high ✌️  

Not just short hyped roller coaster ride 🎢  
Until the life together we can stride 🤝  
I'll be both good friend and life partner 💍  
In both personal and professional chapter 👩‍🎓  

Now I stand in a strong decision 💪  
To bring this love to a family vision 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  
Even if the path is tough to ride 📈  
I’ll hold your hand — and walk beside 👫  

If this turns to love, I’ll hold it tight 🤝  
If not, I’ll still wish you the light ❣️  
Even as your closest friend 👫  
My care for you will never end ♾️  

My love intuition is still optimistic 😌  
If I'm not wrong, I saw an incident click  
I asked you so many times to guess 🙄  
But with brevity now I confess 💐

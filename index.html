    <h1>My Intentions With You</h1>
    <div class="poem">
  <p>Not like the passing clouds ☁️ that quickly pass and fade 💨. I want to be your blue sky 💙 through every low and high ✨️.</p>

  <p>I'll be your sunshine, warm and bright 🌞 — even in dark times, your northern light 🌌. It’s not just about how I feel 😊, but a yearning deep, for you to heal 🕊.</p>

  <p>I heard the whisper of my soul 🧬 — that was the moment I lost control 🌠. I promise, I’ll take care — with heart ❤️‍🩹, not to be your scar, but a healing part 🩹.</p>

  <p>In these emotions, I’m a newborn child 👼. My sighs and plays, gentle and mild 🍼. But if it feels heavy or too hard 🙄, please speak freely — don’t just guard 🔒.</p>

  <p>My intentions aren't just born of lust ❌️ but from deep intuitions I truly trust ✔️. Though feelings are strong, I still hide 🙈 — because I don’t know what's on your side 🤔.</p>

  <p>I know your heart has been through pain 💔 — old love that left a mark like rain 🌧. But I am here with care that's true ❣️, to bring back light and peace to you ✨️.</p>

  <p>You’re a golden soul I long to hold ✨️, but fear your past still has its hold. In my heart, there’s storm and rain ⛈️ — afraid to cause you any pain 🥺.</p>

  <p>I'll not be a cage that easily gets bore 😐, but a sky where you freely explore 🪂. Just flap your wings and freely fly 🕊 — I'll admire as you rise high ✌️.</p>

  <p>Not just a short hyped roller coaster ride 🎢, but until the life together we stride 🤝. I'll be both a good friend and life partner 💍, in both personal and professional chapter 👩‍🎓.</p>

  <p>Now I stand in a strong decision 💪, to bring this love to a family vision 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. Even if the path is tough to ride 📈, I’ll hold your hand — and walk beside 👫.</p>

  <p>If this turns to love, I’ll hold it tight 🤝. If not, I’ll still wish you the light ❣️. Even as your closest friend 👫, my care for you will never end ♾️.</p>

  <p>My love intuition is still optimistic 😌. If I'm not wrong, I saw an incident click. I asked you so many times to guess 🙄 — but with brevity now I confess 💐.</p>
